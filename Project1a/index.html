            and development of computer systems that perform tasks that resembles humans. Some of these actions include
            visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, task completion, and translation between languages and
            human emotions. Main stream media often show films that are normally about robots becoming so smart that they
            over-power the human race.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, this article explains how advancements in artificial intelligence and
            robotics are radically transforming the economy. Throughout the history of automation, jobs that used to require
            humans, such as factory workers or gas pumpers, have diminished and instead are replaced by robots. As a result,
            labor costs are decreased and prices on many different products and services have decreased as well. However,
            this has resulted in a new job market that requires computer science and analytical skills from humans in order
            to operate these machines. More information about this article can be found by clicking the link

            A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between an
            enhanced or wired brain and an external device. This article is about a study
            performed by a group of scientists and neuroengineers at the Ecole Polytechnique
            Federale Lausanne in Switzerland. The team consisted of scientists from the United States,
            Switzerland, and Germany. Together, they were able to use BCI to bypass spinal
            cord injuries in a pair of rhesus macaques for one of their patients.
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the man had restored intentional leg movement in his leg
            which previously was permanently paralyzed. The researchers shared that this
            was the first time a neural prosthetic has been implemented within a human.
            Currently, this advancement in neurology, computer science, and engineering
            has opened the doors for opportunities to further advance research in BCI.

            3-D printing, also formally known as additive manufacturing, is the process of
            making three-dimensional solid object from a digital file. Just as a normal printer,
            the user uploads the file of the three-dimensional object she would like to
            print and then the machine creates that prototype. 3-D printers have resulted
            in many new innovations such as the Square cash card, which allows people to
            insert a device into the phone jack of a cell phone allowing merchandisers to
            accepts credit/debits cards with a cell phone. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article goes into more
            detail about the creations of 3-D printers and other cool gadgets such as
            toy robots, guitars, and even shoes. With so many people learning about
            this new technological advancement, engineers and designers have begun using
            larger, more expensive 3-D printers for more sophisticated creations such as
            prototypes for aerospace, defense, and automotive companies. However, just
            because anybody’s ideas can take shape doesn’t necessarily mean they should.
            Over the years, however, digital design software has matured, scanners have
            become ubiquitous and affordable desktop printers have come within reach of
            self-starting entrepreneurs, schools and home tinkerers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technologists
            boisterously proclaim that 3-D printing will democratize design and free
            us from the negative consequences of mass manufacturing.

            Cloud computing can be described as the different scenarios in which
            computing resources are delivered as a service over a network connection,
            usually the internet. This article, created by Harvard's business review,
            dives into a discussion on how every CEO should not only become informed
            about cloud computing, but should utilize its technological advancements
            for business profits. "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the information technology infrastructure
            at many large companies only makes this challenge more difficult.
            Their technology environments actually impede their ability to sense
            change and respond quickly. " Currently, there is a lot of confusion and
            skepticism within the field of cloud computing, which initially sways people
            away from the topic altogether. However, cloud computing can bring a competitive
            edge to a business by making workers more productive, facilitating collaboration,
            mining insights from data, developing and hosting applications, save money,
            create more stability and reliability, provide more security, and even promote regulation.

            Ironically, big data is a collection of data from traditional and digital
            sources inside and outside of a company that represents a source for ongoing
            discover and analysis. Some limit big data into digital inputs such as web
            behavior and social network interactions, yet there are so many other uses
            this innovation can be used for. Big data typically comes from and unstructured
            form of data that is typically text-heavy. Then there is also the multi-structured
            data that refers to a variety of data formats and types that are derived from
            human to computer interactions.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although these are the two man areas of concern
            for big data, those two areas alone can provide insight into a company or
            business in ways that are so vastly diverse, it can event predict the future
            outcome of a business or business decision before it occurs.

            <h2>User Experience<hr></h2>

            User experience can be described as the experience a person has while using a
            particular product and, generally speaking, how easy or pleasing it is to use.
            A recent study has shown that withint the last 5 years, S&P companies such as
            coca-cola, ford, and Walt Disney have outperformed other industries by 228%.
            One of the factors that play a role in the success of these companies is because
            they are able to see design as much more than just an aesthetic.  
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if you had to use a manual to use the iPhone for the first time,
            this would not be a good design, no matter how beautiful the phone looks,
            or how nice it feels in your hand. When a product is not user-friendly or creates
            a bad user experience, that equals a fundamentally flawed or “bad” design.
            Another factor that all of these companies have in common is that they focus
            on selling experiences rather that products. This is achieved by thinking of
            the customer through every phase of development and even thinking of different
            personas of potential customers. Next, these companies often exceed the
            expectations of their users making "delight" a number one KPI. Furthermore,
            these companies make user experience the company philosophy, so not only
            are the developers/engineers/designers thinking of the customers through
            every phase of development, but also the business analysts, customer
            service representatives, ad other types of employees. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, all of these
            companies take the time and effort necessary to understand their customers
            with the hopes of reaching a more vast, diverse client-base.

            The internet of things can be described as the internet of computing devices
            embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send or receive data. Additionally,
            if one thing can prevent the internet of things transforming the way we live and
            word, it would be because of a breakdown in security. This article shares an
            interesting perspective on how the internet of things are far bigger than majority
            of people even realize. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in 2007 there was a bridge collapse in my
            home state in Minnesota. As a result of the steel plates inadequately
            supporting the bridge's load, it eventually collapsed killing many people.
            Through the use of the internet of things, the state of minnesota has utilized
            technology in order to retrieve data about the quality of bridges by using smart
            cement. If there’s ice on the bridge, the same sensors in the concrete will
            detect it and communicate the information via the wireless internet to your
            car. Once your car knows there’s a hazard ahead, it will instruct the driver
            to slow down, and if the driver doesn’t, then the car will slow down for him.
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the technology trends that are taking place right now, perhaps the
            biggest one is the Internet of Things. It is s the only technology that’s
            going to give us the most disruption, as well as opportunities in the future
            of the human race.
